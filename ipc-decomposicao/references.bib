  abstract = {Introduction: In 2010, there were 305 (37.8\%) municipalities with malaria epidemics in the Brazilian Amazon. The epidemics spread can be explained by the spatial distribution pattern. Objective: To analyze the spatial dependence, autocorrelation, of the malaria epidemics in the municipalities of this region. Methods: An automated algorithm was used for the detection of epidemic municipalities in 2003, 2007 and 2010. Spatial dependence was analyzed by applying the global and local Moran index on the epidemic months proportion variable. The epidemic municipalities clusters were identified using the TerraView software. Results: The global Moran index values were 0.4 in 2003; 0.6 in 2007; and 0.5 in 2010 (p = 0.01), confirming the spatial dependence among the epidemic municipalities. Box Map and Moran Map identified inter-municipal, interstate and borders clusters with spatial autocorrelation (p {$<$} 0.05). There were 10 epidemic municipalities clusters in 2003; 9 in 2007 and 8 in 2010. Discussion: The epidemic municipalities clusters may be linked to the health facilities difficulties on acting together. The structural limitations of the health services can be overcome by territorial integration to support planning and control activities, strengthening the interventions. Conclusion: The routine analysis of the epidemic municipalities clusters with spatial and temporal persistence may provide a new indicator of planning and integrated control prioritization, contributing to malaria epidemics reducing in inter-municipal, interstate and borders areas.},

  abstract = {Malaria in Brazil is virtually restricted to the Amazon Region, where it has a heterogeneous geographic distribution. We reviewed secondary data in order to describe the regional and temporal distribution of 8018 malaria cases seen between 2003 and 2007 in Santa Isabel do Rio Negro, a municipality in the northwest Brazilian Amazon. A significant rise in malaria incidence, mainly in the Yanomami Indian reservation, was observed during this time. Anopheline breeding sites were also mapped and entomological data were obtained through the capture of larval and adult mosquitoes. Thirty-three potential breeding sites were identified in the urban and periurban areas, 28 of which were positive for anopheline larvae. Anopheles darlingi specimens were captured in both intra- and peridomicile locations in the urban areas. Demographic data were also assessed via a sectional survey, revealing that the majority of dwellings were vulnerable to mosquitoes. This study suggests that urban and periurban areas of this municipality are highly susceptible to epidemic malaria, which is endemic in the Yanomami Indian reservation near the city. In addition, transmission can be perpetuated autochthonously in the urban area, drawing attention to the continuous need for preventative measures such as controlling adult and aquatic stages of mosquitoes and improving housing.},

  abstract = {Despite the recent malaria burden reduction in the Americas, focal transmission persists across the Amazon Basin. Timely analysis of surveillance data is crucial to characterize high-risk individuals and households for better targeting of regional elimination efforts. Here we analyzed 5,480 records of laboratory-confirmed clinical malaria episodes combined with demographic and socioeconomic information to identify risk factors for elevated malaria incidence in M\^ancio Lima, the main urban transmission hotspot of Brazil. Overdispersed malaria count data clustered into households were fitted with random-effects zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. Random-effect predictors were used to characterize the spatial heterogeneity in malaria risk at the household level. Adult males were identified as the population stratum at greatest risk, likely due to increased occupational exposure away of the town. However, poor housing and residence in the less urbanized periphery of the town were also found to be key predictors of malaria risk, consistent with a substantial local transmission. Two thirds of the 8,878 urban residents remained uninfected after 23,975 person-years of follow-up. Importantly, we estimated that nearly 14\% of them, mostly children and older adults living in the central urban hub, were free of malaria risk, being either unexposed, naturally unsusceptible, or immune to infection. We conclude that statistical modeling of routinely collected, but often neglected, malaria surveillance data can be explored to characterize drivers of transmission heterogeneity at the community level and provide evidence for the rational deployment of control interventions.},

We analysed the incidence of slide-confirmed symptomatic infections diagnosed between 2001 and 2006 in a cohort of 531 individuals (2281.53 person-years of follow-up) and parasite prevalence data derived from four cross-sectional surveys. Overall, the incidence rates of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum were 20.6/100 and 6.8/100 person-years at risk, respectively, with a marked decline in the incidence of both species (81.4 and 56.8\%, respectively) observed between 2001 and 2006. PCR revealed 5.4-fold more infections than conventional microscopy in population-wide cross-sectional surveys carried out between 2004 and 2006 (average prevalence, 11.3 vs. 2.0\%). Only 27.2\% of PCR-positive (but 73.3\% of slide-positive) individuals had symptoms when enrolled, indicating that asymptomatic carriage of low-grade parasitaemias is a common phenomenon in frontier settlements. A circular cluster comprising 22.3\% of the households, all situated in the area of most recent occupation, comprised 69.1\% of all malaria infections diagnosed during the follow-up, with malaria incidence decreasing exponentially with distance from the cluster centre. By targeting one-quarter of the households, with selective indoor spraying or other house-protection measures, malaria incidence could be reduced by more than two-thirds in this community.},

Methods: Using methods from behavioral ecology, we conducted a quantitative ethnography and collected data to inform of individual behavioral profiles. Individual malarial infection reports were available from the local public health offices, so each behavioral profile was associated with an epidemic profile for the past 5 years. Results: Our research shows that, in-line with current opinion, malaria among the N\"ukak is not associated with an occupational hazard risk and follows a holoendemic pattern, where children are most susceptible to the parasite. Parasite loads of malarial infection among the N\"ukak persist at much higher rates than in any other neighboring ethnicity, which indicates an association between high incidence rates and endemicity. Conclusions: We hypothesize that malarial infection in the forest follows a pattern where the parasite persists in pockets of holoendemicity, and occupational hazard risk for individuals outside those pockets is associated with behaviors that take place in the proximity of the pockets of endemicity.},

  abstract = {The resurgence of the malaria eradication agenda and the increasing number of severe manifestation reports has contributed to a renewed interested in the Plasmodium vivax infection. It is the most geographically widespread parasite causing human malaria, with around 2.85 billion people living under risk of infection. The Brazilian Amazon region reports more than 50\% of the malaria cases in Latin America and since 1990 there is a marked predominance of this species, responsible for 85\% of cases in 2009. However, only a few complicated cases of P. vivax have been reported from this region. A systematic review of the Brazilian indexed and non-indexed literature on complicated cases of vivax malaria was performed including published articles, masters' dissertations, doctoral theses and national congresses' abstracts. The following information was retrieved: patient characteristics (demographic, presence of co-morbidities and, whenever possible, associated genetic disorders); description of each major clinical manifestation. As a result, 27 articles, 28 abstracts from scientific events' annals and 13 theses/dissertations were found, only after 1987. Most of the reported information was described in small case series and case reports of patients from all the Amazonian states, and also in travellers from Brazilian non-endemic areas. The more relevant clinical complications were anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, jaundice and acute respiratory distress syndrome, present in all age groups, in addition to other more rare clinical pictures. Complications in pregnant women were also reported. Acute and chronic co-morbidities were frequent, however death was occasional. Clinical atypical cases of malaria are more frequent than published in the indexed literature, probably due to a publication bias. In the Brazilian Amazon (considered to be a low to moderate intensity area of transmission), clinical data are in accordance with the recent findings of severity described in diverse P. vivax endemic areas (especially anaemia in Southeast Asia), however in this region both children and adults are affected. Finally, gaps of knowledge and areas for future research are opportunely pointed out.},

  abstract = {Background In Brazil malaria is most frequent in the Amazon region, mainly in the Amazonas state, where it is found the most proportion of indigenous people of the whole country. It is remarkable publications about malaria in the Amazon, although information on malaria in indigenous populations is still poorly explored. Objective Identify factors associated with malaria in indigenous populations. Methods Cross-sectional study of positive cases of malaria in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, from 2007 to 2016. Secondary data were obtained from the Epidemiological Surveillance Information System for Malaria and from the Mortality Information System, both from Brazil. To tackle with race missing data, cases with no race fulfilled were classified according to the probable location where infection occurred. This way, was imputed indigenous race for those which the probable infection location was indigenous village (aldeia). Variables tested with race were: sex, age, schooling, microscope surveillance slide type, parasitic infection species, parasitemia level, and timeliness of treatment. Multivariate logistic regression was used. Results A total of 1,055,852 cases of malaria were notified in the state of Amazonas. Among the factors that associate malaria and indigenous peoples, the most significant were sex, children and high levels of parasitemia. The magnitude of Plasmodium vivax infection is higher than Plasmodium falciparum, although this parasite was more frequent in indigenous than other races. In regards to mortality, 109 deaths were registered, most of them related to P. vivax. Conclusion The findings underscore the importance of look at indigenous people differently of other races. The associated factors highlight a profile of cases severity, because of highest parasitemia, many cases of P. falciparum although high frequency of P. vivax, and children. Furthermore, the mortality in indigenous, specially in older people is worrying},

  abstract = {After a centenary fight against malaria, Brazil has seen an opportunity for change with the proposal of the malaria elimination policy set by the Brazilian government, in line with malaria elimination policies in other Latin American countries. Brazilian malaria experts regard eliminating malaria by 2030 to be within reach. Herein we evaluated the likelihood that malaria elimination can be accomplished in Brazil through systematic review of the literature on malaria elimination in Brazil and epidemiological analysis. Fifty-two articles referring to malaria eradication/elimination in Brazil were analyzed to identify challenges and technological breakthroughs for controlling malaria. Monthly deaths (1979\textendash 2016) and monthly severe malaria cases (1998\textendash 2018) were analyzed according to age groups, geographic region and parasite species. As a result, we observed that the declining malaria burden was mostly attributable to a decline in Plasmodium falciparum-malaria. At the same time, the proportional increase of Plasmodium vivax-malaria in comparison with P. falciparum-malaria was notable. This niche replacement mechanism was discussed in the reviewed literature. In addition, the challenges to P. vivax-malaria elimination outnumbered the available technological breakthroughs. Although accumulated and basic information exists on mosquito vector biology, the lack of specific knowledge about mosquito vector taxonomy and ecology may hamper current attempts at stopping malaria in the country. An impressive reduction in malaria hospitalizations and mortality was seen in Brazil in the past 3 decades. Eliminating malaria deaths in children less than 5 years and P. falciparum severe cases may be achievable goals under the current malaria policy until 2030. However, eliminating P. vivax malaria transmission and morbidity seems unattainable with the available tools. Therefore, complete malaria elimination in Brazil in the near future is unlikely.},

The basic treatment scheme for this disease is chloroquine and primaquine. This study evaluated the epidemiological profile of malaria in Rond\^onia between 2008 and 2012. Methodology: The epidemiological data were provided by the Health Surveillance Agency from the State of Rond\^onia, and socioeconomic indicators were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System, and from the National Institute for Space Research. The analyzed variables included year of diagnosis, gender, age group, main activity performed in the 15 days previous to the diagnosis, parasite species, level of parasitemia, number of relapse/recrudescence cases, and socioeconomic and environmental data for Rond\^onia. Results: A total of 238,626 cases of malaria were recorded in Rond\^onia during the study period. Of this total, 65.6\% were men and the most prevalent age group was 20\textendash 39 years. Plasmodium vivax was the most common parasite (89.8\%), followed by Plasmodium~~ falciparum (9.4\%). An average of 30.9\% of the individuals who were tested presented with relapse/recrudescence malaria. The API value was highest in 2008 and lowest in 2012, corresponding to 42.3 cases and 19.2 cases per 1,000 inhabitants, respectively. Conclusions: A 58\% reduction in the number of malaria cases and a 36.2\% reduction in the number of relapse/recrudescence malaria cases were observed, due to increases in the economy, improvements in the health system, and reduction of deforestation in this region.},

  abstract = {"The World Health Organization's Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030 has been developed with the aim of helping countries reduce the human suffering caused by the world's deadliest mosquito-borne disease. Adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015, the strategy provides comprehensive technical guidance to countries and development partners for the next 15 years, emphasizing the importance of scaling up malaria responses and moving towards elimination. It also highlights the urgent need to increase investments across all interventions--including preventive measures, diagnostic testing, treatment and disease surveillance--as well as in harnessing innovation and expanding research. By adopting this strategy, WHO Member States have endorsed the bold vision of a world free of malaria, and set the ambitious new target of reducing the global malaria burden by 90\% by 2030. They also agreed to strengthen health systems, address emerging multi-drug and insecticide resistance, and intensify national, cross-border and regional efforts to scale up malaria responses to protect everyone at risk. By taking forward this strategy, countries will make a major contribution to implementing the post-2015 sustainable development framework. A major scale-up of malaria responses will not only help countries reach the health related targets for 2030, but will contribute to poverty reduction and other development goals. In the next 18 months, we will develop and roll out implementation plans in all WHO regions and support countries in updating their national malaria plans. We stand ready to expand our reach and increase our support to all countries irrespective of where they are along the elimination continuum. Recent progress on malaria has shown us that, with adequate investments and the right mix of strategies, we can indeed make remarkable strides against this complicated enemy. We will need strong political commitment to see this through, and expanded financing. We should act with resolve, and remain focused on our shared goal: to create a world in which no one dies of malaria. I remain confident that if we act with urgency and determination, we can beat this disease once and for all."--Page 3.},
